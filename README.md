# FriendFinder
Find friends in a tiny database.

Database starts with one user, Minnie Mouse, who's responses are all 3 except question 1, which is set to 1

Minnie will of course be the match first time through because that is the only user in the DB

Assuming you ran it the first time with Mickey all default, if you re-submit another Mickey, the old Mickey will become the new best match because answers will be all 3.
